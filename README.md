# Candidate Finder App

## Description

The **Candidate Finder App** is a web application designed to search for potential candidates on GitHub using the GitHub API. This app allows users to search for GitHub profiles based on specific search criteria, providing relevant details about developers, their skills, and their activity on GitHub.

The application is built using **React** and **TypeScript** to offer a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface. It leverages the **GitHub REST API** to gather candidate data dynamically, ensuring that users receive up-to-date and accurate information directly from GitHub.

## Usage

1. Once the app is loaded, you'll see a search bar where you can enter GitHub search keywords (e.g., specific technologies or GitHub usernames).
2. The app will display a list of candidates (GitHub users) that match the search query, including basic profile information like username, avatar, and repositories.
3. Clicking on a candidate’s profile will take you to a detailed view of their GitHub activity, including repositories, stars, forks, and contributions.
4. If the search query is invalid or no candidates match, the app will show an error message or prompt the user to refine the search.
